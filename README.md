# Plaso Android Accounts Parser Plugin

This plugin is designed to parse and process Android Accounts  data within the Plaso framework. It extracts key information such as the timestamp, account_name, account_type, account_type, and last_password_entry_time. Using custom event data classes, the plugin structures the parsed data to integrate smoothly with Plasoâ€™s timeline generation.
